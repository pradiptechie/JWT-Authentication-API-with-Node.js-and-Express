#This repository provides a comprehensive solution for building secure authentication APIs using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in Node.js with Express. The API allows users to sign up, log in, and log out securely.

##Key Features:
- User Authentication: Implement a robust authentication system using JWT to securely authenticate users.
- Signup: Allow users to create new accounts by providing necessary information such as username and password.
- Login: Enable users to securely log in to their accounts using their credentials.
- Logout: Provide a secure mechanism for users to log out and invalidate their JWT tokens.
- Middleware Integration: Utilize middleware functions to authenticate and authorize API endpoints.
- Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to provide informative responses for various scenarios.

This project aims to provide a flexible and reliable authentication solution for building secure APIs with JWT authentication. Whether you're creating a web application, mobile app backend, or any other type of server-side application, this repository serves as a solid foundation for implementing user authentication securely.
